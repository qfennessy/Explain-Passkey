# Comparison: Passkeys vs. SSH Keys for GitHub Authentication

## Similarities

1. **Cryptographic Basis**: Both passkeys and SSH keys use public-key cryptography for authentication.

2. **Private Key Security**: In both cases, the private key remains on the user's device and is never transmitted over the network.

3. **Phishing Resistance**: Both methods are resistant to phishing attacks since the private key isn't directly exposed.

4. **No Shared Secrets**: Neither method requires a shared secret (like a password) to be stored on the server.

## Differences

1. **Key Management**:
   - SSH Keys: Users typically generate, store, and manage their SSH keys manually.
   - Passkeys: Key management is usually handled automatically by the operating system or password manager.

2. **Authentication Process**:
   - SSH Keys: Often require manual selection of the key or specifying the key in a config file.
   - Passkeys: Usually integrated with the OS or browser for a smoother, more automated experience.

3. **User Experience**:
   - SSH Keys: Require more technical knowledge to set up and use.
   - Passkeys: Designed for a more user-friendly experience, often using biometrics or device PINs.

4. **Portability**:
   - SSH Keys: Require manual copying of key files when moving to a new device.
   - Passkeys: Can often be synced across devices through cloud services (e.g., iCloud Keychain).

5. **Scope of Use**:
   - SSH Keys: Primarily used for developer-oriented services like GitHub, servers, etc.
   - Passkeys: Designed for broader use across various web services and applications.

6. **Integration with Services**:
   - SSH Keys: Well-established for services like GitHub, requiring specific setup steps.
   - Passkeys: Newer technology, requiring services to specifically implement support.

7. **Revocation and Rotation**:
   - SSH Keys: Manual process to revoke or rotate keys.
   - Passkeys: Often have built-in mechanisms for easier revocation and rotation.

8. **Multi-Device Use**:
   - SSH Keys: Require separate key generation and setup for each device.
   - Passkeys: Can often be used seamlessly across multiple devices (within the same ecosystem).

## Practical Implications for GitHub Usage

1. **Setup Process**:
   - SSH Keys: Require generating a key pair, adding the public key to GitHub, and configuring the SSH agent.
   - Passkeys: Would require GitHub to implement passkey support, after which setup would likely be more streamlined.

2. **Daily Use**:
   - SSH Keys: Once set up, authentication is relatively seamless for command-line operations.
   - Passkeys: Could potentially offer a smoother experience, especially for web-based interactions.

3. **Security Model**:
   - SSH Keys: Rely on the security of the user's system and their ability to protect the private key.
   - Passkeys: Often leverage hardware-based security features of modern devices.

4. **Adoption and Support**:
   - SSH Keys: Currently the standard for secure GitHub authentication.
   - Passkeys: Not yet supported by GitHub as of the last update, but could be a future possibility.

In conclusion, while both methods offer strong security, passkeys are designed to provide a more user-friendly and integrated experience across a broader range of services. However, for developer-focused platforms like GitHub, the established SSH key system remains a powerful and flexible option, particularly for command-line and scripted operations.
