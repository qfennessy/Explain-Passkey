## What is a Passkey?

A passkey is a new, passwordless method of logging into apps and websites. It's designed to be simpler, faster, and more secure than traditional passwords.   
Technically, it's a cryptographic key pair - one public key registered with the online service and one private key that remains on your device. Authentication happens when you prove you have the private key, usually through biometrics (fingerprint, face scan) or a device PIN/pattern.   


## Costs and Benefits of Passkeys

### Costs:
#### Initial Setup
May require some effort to set up initially across your accounts and devices.
#### Device Dependency
Relies heavily on having your device. Losing your primary device could temporarily lock you out of accounts until you regain access or use account recovery options.
#### Adoption
Not universally supported yet, though adoption is growing.

### Benefits:
#### Phishing Resistant
Passkeys are much harder to phish since they aren't transmitted over the network like passwords.   

#### No Password Reuse
Each passkey is unique to each site/app, eliminating the risk of one leaked password compromising multiple accounts.   
#### Stronger Security
Tied to your device and biometrics, making them harder to steal or guess.   
#### Ease of Use: 
No need to remember complex passwords, just unlock your device.   
#### Built-in 2FA: 
Many implementations require both the private key on your device and your biometric or device PIN, essentially providing two-factor authentication without the extra steps.   

## Specific Examples of Passkey Usage

### Mac Keychain 

On macOS devices, passkeys can be stored securely in the Keychain, alongside passwords. When you visit a compatible site, the Keychain will prompt you to authenticate with biometrics or your device password.

### Password Vault Apps
Many password managers like 1Password, Dashlane, and Bitwarden are adding support for passkeys, allowing you to manage them alongside your passwords.   
### Other

Several major platforms and services already support passkeys including Google, Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, eBay, and more.   

## Comparison to Other Methods

### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication): 
Passkeys often offer a similar level of security to 2FA, but with a simpler user experience since the second factor (biometrics or device PIN) is often built-in.  

### Passwords: 
Passkeys are superior to passwords in terms of security and ease of use. Passwords are vulnerable to phishing, brute-force attacks, and reuse across multiple sites. 
  
### Hardware Keys
Hardware keys provide strong security and phishing resistance, similar to passkeys. However, they require carrying a physical device and may not be as convenient for everyday use on mobile devices.   

In summary, passkeys represent a significant step forward in authentication, offering stronger security and a better user experience than traditional passwords. While not yet universally supported, their adoption is growing rapidly, and they are poised to become the standard for secure logins in the near future.

A passkey is a modern authentication method designed to replace traditional passwords. Let me break down the key aspects of passkeys, including their costs, benefits, and how they compare to other authentication methods.

What is a passkey?
A passkey is a digital credential that allows users to authenticate themselves to websites and applications without using a traditional password. Instead, it uses public key cryptography to create a unique pair of cryptographic keys for each account.

Costs:
1. Implementation costs for websites and services to support passkeys
2. Potential learning curve for users unfamiliar with the technology
3. Dependency on device availability (e.g., smartphone or computer)

Benefits:
1. Enhanced security compared to traditional passwords
2. Resistance to phishing attacks
3. Easier and faster login process for users
4. No need to remember complex passwords
5. Cross-platform compatibility

Comparison to other authentication methods:

1. Passkeys vs. Passwords:
   - Passkeys are more secure, as they can't be guessed or stolen like passwords
   - Passkeys eliminate the need to create and remember complex passwords
   - Passkeys are unique to each site, unlike passwords that are often reused

2. Passkeys vs. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
   - Passkeys provide similar security benefits to 2FA without the extra step
   - 2FA often requires a separate device or app, while passkeys are integrated into the device
   - Passkeys are resistant to phishing attacks, unlike some 2FA methods (e.g., SMS-based)

3. Passkeys vs. Hardware Keys (e.g., YubiKey):
   - Both offer high security and phishing resistance
   - Hardware keys require a physical device, while passkeys are built into existing devices
   - Passkeys are more convenient for most users and don't require carrying an additional device

Specific examples of passkey usage:

1. Mac Keychain:
   Apple has integrated passkey support into its iCloud Keychain. When you create an account on a passkey-supported website using Safari on macOS:
   - The system generates a passkey and stores it in iCloud Keychain
   - You can then use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate on your Mac
   - The passkey syncs across your Apple devices via iCloud

2. Password vault apps:
   Many password managers now support passkeys. For example, with 1Password:
   - You can create and store passkeys for supported websites
   - The app manages your passkeys alongside your traditional passwords
   - You can use biometrics (e.g., fingerprint) to unlock your vault and use passkeys

3. Google Account:
   Google has implemented passkey support for its accounts:
   - You can set up a passkey for your Google Account on Android or iOS devices
   - When signing in, you'll be prompted to use your device's biometric authentication or PIN
   - This replaces the need for a password or 2FA code

4. Microsoft Account:
   Microsoft supports passkeys for personal accounts:
   - You can create a passkey using the Microsoft Authenticator app
   - When signing in to a Microsoft service, you'll be prompted to use your passkey
   - This can be done via biometric authentication or a PIN on your device

In summary, passkeys offer a more secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional passwords. They provide similar security benefits to 2FA and hardware keys but with added convenience. As more services adopt passkey support, we can expect to see a gradual shift away from password-based authentication towards this more secure method.

### What is a Passkey?

A **passkey** is a modern authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with a cryptographic key pair. This key pair is generated on your device and is used to authenticate you with online services, providing a more secure and convenient login experience. The public key is stored on the server, while the private key remains securely on your device.

### Costs

- **Direct Costs**: Passkeys themselves are generally free as they are a feature integrated into modern operating systems and web browsers. The cost might come from the devices or services that utilize passkeys, such as a smartphone, a Mac, or a subscription to a password vault app.
- **Indirect Costs**: The indirect costs include the investment in compatible hardware (like a new phone or computer) and any associated services, such as cloud backups or additional security features in password managers.

### Benefits

- **Security**: Passkeys eliminate the risk of phishing, as the private key never leaves your device and cannot be intercepted or spoofed.
- **Convenience**: Users no longer need to remember complex passwords. Authentication is seamless, often just requiring biometric confirmation (e.g., Face ID, fingerprint) or a PIN.
- **Resilience**: Since passkeys are tied to a physical device, they reduce the risk of brute-force attacks that target password databases.

### How Passkeys are Used

- **Mac Keychain**: Apple has integrated passkeys into iCloud Keychain, allowing users to generate and store passkeys for supported websites and apps. For example, when you log into a website on Safari, your Mac may suggest creating a passkey. This passkey is stored in iCloud Keychain and can be accessed across your Apple devices.
  
- **Password Vault Apps**: Services like 1Password or Dashlane are starting to support passkeys. When you create a passkey for a service, it’s stored in the vault, which synchronizes across devices, providing a seamless login experience across platforms.

### Comparison to Other Authentication Methods

- **Passwords**: Passkeys are inherently more secure than traditional passwords because they cannot be phished or reused across multiple sites. Passwords are vulnerable to breaches, whereas passkeys are not exposed in the same way.

- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**: While 2FA adds a layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (like an SMS code), it can be cumbersome and is still vulnerable to phishing. Passkeys provide a similar level of security without the need for extra steps, making the user experience smoother.

- **Hardware Keys and YubiKey**: Hardware security keys like YubiKey offer high security by requiring physical possession of the key for authentication. Passkeys provide a similar level of security but with more convenience since they don't require an external device—just the user's own smartphone or computer.

### Specific Examples

1. **Logging into a Banking App**: Instead of entering a password, a passkey stored in your password manager or Mac Keychain automatically logs you in after biometric verification.
  
2. **Website Authentication**: When signing into a service like Dropbox, you may be prompted to create a passkey. Once created, subsequent logins can be done with just your fingerprint or facial recognition on your device.

3. **Cross-Device Usage**: If you set up a passkey on your iPhone for a website, you can seamlessly use it on your Mac without any extra setup, thanks to iCloud Keychain's synchronization.

### Conclusion

Passkeys represent a significant advancement in authentication technology, offering enhanced security and user experience compared to traditional methods like passwords and 2FA. While they provide the convenience of not needing to remember passwords and eliminate many common security vulnerabilities, the adoption of passkeys is still growing, and they are most beneficial in ecosystems that fully support them, such as Apple’s and modern password managers.
